# GrantID - Checking the system logs on Docker

The Docker image for [GrantID](../index.md) sends its logs to the standard output, which in turn gets registered
by Docker as service logs. To check the *grantid* service logs:

[!include[Check GrantID logs](../../../../../../includes/grant-id/docker/check-logs-grantid.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> On the commands shown on this article, the leftmost `grantid` is the name of the stack, while the rightmost part is the name
> of the service (in the case above, the *grantid* service). If you deployed your stack with another name, say *patorumid*, you
> would need to replace the leftmost `grantid` on the commands shown here with the name of your stack (e.g. *patorumid_grantid*).

You can also check the SQL Server logs:

[!include[Check SQL logs](../../../../../../includes/grant-id/docker/check-logs-sql.md)]

And also the Nginx logs:

[!include[Check Nginx logs](../../../../../../includes/grant-id/docker/check-logs-nginx.md)]
