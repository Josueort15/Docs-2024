# Lacuna PSC

Lacuna PSC is a companion system to [Amplia](../amplia/index.md) to store and manage cloud certificates.

This system is 100% compatible with [DOC-ICP-17.01](https://www.gov.br/iti/pt-br/central-de-conteudo/doc-icp-17-01-verso-2-0-pdf),
which means that the service interface is implemented with the OAuth 2.0 framework (RFC 6749 and RFC 7636).

## On-premises

Lacuna PSC can be used as a service (SaaS) or you can host your own instance. See the article [Lacuna PSC on-premises](on-premises/index.md) for more information.
