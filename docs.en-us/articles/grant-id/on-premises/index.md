## Planning before installation

Before you start, you should have the following public domains defined and created on the corresponding DNS servers, pointing to the server
that will host your GrantID instance:

* **Base domain**: base domain of the sites where users sign in.
* **Login domain**: hosts the actual site where users sign in. Must be a subdomain of the base domain.
* **Console domain**: hosts the dashboard that system administrators will use to configure GrantID itself.
* **API domain** (optional): hosts the GrantID API. The API does not need to be publicly accessible, so this is optional.

> [!NOTE]
> Although only the login domain needs to be a subdomain of the base domain, we recommend choosing a base domain and defining the remaining
> domains as subdomains of it.

For instance, suppose you choose as a base domain **easyid.net**:

Domain type | Chosen domain name
----------- | ------------------
Base domain | *easyid.net*
Login       | **login**.*easyid.net*
Console     | **console**.*easyid.net*
API         | **api**.*easyid.net*

Instead suppose you have an existing organizational domain, say *patorum.com*, and prefer to use a subdomain as the GrantID base
domain, for instance **id.patorum.com**:

Domain type | Chosen domain name
----------- | ------------------
Base domain | *id.patorum.com*
Login       | **login**.*id.patorum.com*
Console     | **console**.*id.patorum.com*
API         | **api**.*id.patorum.com*

> [!NOTE]
> Ideally, you should also have a valid SSL certificate that encompasses the four domains before starting the installation.
> However, you can install GrantID without HTTPS and configure it later.
