# Rest PKI Core

**Rest PKI Core** is an upcoming version of [Rest PKI](../index.md) that will have extended compatibility with environments and databases.

In addition to Windows Server (which is already supported by Rest PKI), Rest PKI Core will also run on **Linux** (Debian- and RedHat-based distributions)
and on **Docker**. As for database servers, in addition to SQL Server, **PostgreSQL** will also be supported.

## SaaS and on-premises

Rest PKI Core can be used as a service (SaaS) on [core.pki.rest](https://core.pki.rest/) or you can host your own instance. See the article
[Rest PKI Core on-premises](on-premises/index.md) for more information.

## Roadmap and Rest PKI compatibility

Versions 1.x of Rest PKI Core will have some, but not all, of the features currently available on Rest PKI 1.x (plus some additional features of its own).
As the development of Rest PKI Core progresses, more and more features avaliable on Rest PKI will be supported. When Rest PKI Core reaches full compatibility
with Rest PKI, version 2.0 will be released, unifiying both modules and being simply called *Rest PKI 2*.

The expected relase date of the 2.0 version that will unify Rest PKI and Rest PKI Core is around the second semester of 2021.

> [!NOTE]
> Some deprecated APIs might be dropped on Rest PKI 2. Try to use the latest versions of each API.
