### Database connection string

Under section **ConnectionStrings**, on the setting **DefaultConnection**, set the connection string to the previously created database. A typical connection string looks like this:

```
Data Source=SERVER;Initial Catalog=DATABASE;User ID=USERNAME;Password=PASSWORD
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you created the database using advanced features such as log shipping or mirroring, your connection string may be different
